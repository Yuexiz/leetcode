# LeetCodeCN-Submissions-Crawler

This project is a crawler used to crawl the code submitted to Leetcode-CN by programmers.

# Inspiration
**With three months of hard work,** 

**I solved four hundred questions.**

**A green leetcode dashboard is nice,**

**but my github is just white.**

Manual uploading is impossible, and I would never do that in my whole life.

After some search, I only found the submission crawler of LeetCode. So I had to build wheels by myself.
